## 🧭 How It Works

![Landing Page](1.png)

## 🚀  Landing Page
### The user is greeted with a welcoming and intuitive interface to begin the journey.

![Favorites Selection](2.png)


## ⭐  Step 1: User Favorites
#### Users select their favorite:
#### - TV shows
#### - Movies
#### - Games
#### These selections are sent to the Qloo API to begin building a taste profile.
#### The Qloo API then returns similar media. If the user says they like the media suggested, it is added to their profile and informs any further searches


## 🎭 4. Step 2: Avatar & Personality Creation
#### GPT-4.1 uses the taste profile generated by Qloo and learning background to generate a tutor avatar with:
#### - Personality traits (e.g., calm, energetic, funny)
#### - Clothing styles
#### - Skin tone

## 🤖 6. Step 5: Tutor Agent Activation
#### Once the avatar is complete the Tutor Agent (GPT-4.1) is activated.
#### 
#### The user is taken to the live tutoring page, which includes:
#### - Top Right: AI whiteboard for step-by-step guidance
#### - Bottom Right: User’s whiteboard for working out problems
#### - Left Panel: Avatar and live conversation area

# Here, the Tutor AI agent can dynamically:
#### - Generate personalized educational content and whiteboard content
#### - Communicate through the avatar in the top-left of the screen
#### - Adapt teaching style to the student’s responses
